In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Specifically, it involves strong reference cycles within blocks. Consider this example:

```objectivec
@property (nonatomic, strong) MyObject *myObject;

// ... later in your code ...

[self.myObject doSomethingWithCompletion:^(NSError *error) {
    if (error) {
        // Handle error
    } else {
        // This block retains 'self' implicitly. 
        // If myObject also holds a strong reference to self (e.g., via a delegate), this creates a retain cycle.
        [self performSelector:@selector(someMethod) withObject:nil afterDelay:1];
    }
}];
```

The block captures `self` implicitly, creating a strong reference. If `myObject` also has a strong reference back to `self` (perhaps via a delegate property), a retain cycle forms: `self` -> `myObject` -> `block` -> `self`. Neither object gets deallocated, leading to memory leaks.

Another subtle issue might be improper use of `copy` in properties:

```objectivec
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *someString;

// ... later ...
self.someString = [self.someString stringByAppendingString:@
